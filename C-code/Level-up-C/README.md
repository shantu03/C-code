All programmers must keep their coding muscles toned, which requires regular challenges and review of best practices. Beginners desire realistic exercises to continue their education, and experienced coders must constantly brush up on the basics as well as those areas of C that programmers often have issues with, such as pointers, recursion, and systems programming. In this course, Dan Gookin provides challenges for coders across the C knowledge spectrum with regular exercises to keep their programming skills fresh and ready for their next opportunity.<br><br>This course is integrated with GitHub Codespaces, an instant cloud developer environment that offers all the functionality of your favorite IDE without the need for any local machine setup. With GitHub Codespaces, you can get hands-on practice from any machine, at any time—all while using a tool that you’ll likely encounter in the workplace. <br><br>Each installment of the <em>Level Up</em> series offers at least 15 bite-sized opportunities to practice programming at various levels of difficulty, so you can challenge yourself and reinforce what you’ve learned. Check out the [Using GitHub Codespaces with this course][gcs-video-url] video to learn how to get a codespace up and running.
